The image shows a room with rows of chairs, and we need to focus on the back row specifically.\n1. Identify the back row: The back row is the row furthest from the camera, where the people are seated.\n2. Locate the middle chair: In the back row, there are multiple chairs. The middle one would be the third chair from either side.\n3. Confirm the bounding box: The bounding box should encompass the area of the chair in the middle of the back row.\n\nFollowing these steps, I can now provide the bounding box coordinates for the middle chair in the back row.\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n```json\n[\n\t{\"bbox_2d\": [248, 356, 401, 476], \"label\": \"middle chair in back row\"}\n]\n```json\n</answer>",
