The second glass should be further away from the camera than the first one.\n\nIn the image:\n- The first glass is the one closest to the camera on the left side.\n- The second glass is the one further back and to the right of the first one.\n\nThe final answer is based on these observations.\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n```json\n[\n\t{\"bbox_2d\": [314, 132, 376, 295], \"label\": \"a wine glass to the back right of another glass.\"}\n]\n```json\n</answer>",
