To remove the camera, we need to find the \"Camera\" option and its corresponding minus sign icon.\n\n1. Locate the \"Camera\" option in the \"INCLUDED CONTROLS\" section.\n2. Identify the minus sign icon next to the \"Camera\" option.\n3. Determine the bounding box that encompasses both the \"Camera\" text and the minus sign icon.\n\nThe bounding box coordinates for the \"Camera\" option and the minus sign icon can be identified as follows:\n- Top-left corner (x1, y1): (X1, Y1)\n- Bottom-right corner (x2, y2): (X2, Y2)\n\nAfter identifying these coordinates, the final answer would be represented in JSON format as:\n```json\n{\n  \"bounding_box\": {\n    \"top_left\": [X1, Y1],\n    \"bottom_right\": [X2, Y2]\n  }\n}\n```\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n```json\n{\n  \"bounding_box\": {\n    \"top_left\": [9",
