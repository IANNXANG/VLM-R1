Typically, this can be found in the device's settings or within the Android Studio interface itself. Given the current view, it seems like there might not be a direct volume control visible here. However, if we assume the volume control is accessible through the device manager or another part of the interface, we should look for a settings icon or a similar option related to device management.\n\nSince the exact location isn't visible, I'll make an educated guess based on common UI patterns. The settings icon (gear icon) is often used to access device settings, which may include volume controls. If the gear icon is present, clicking it could lead us to the volume control options.\n</think>\n<answer> [1014, 712] </answer>",
