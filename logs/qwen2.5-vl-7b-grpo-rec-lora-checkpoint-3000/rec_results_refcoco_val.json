However, based on their relative positions, the second bear from the left seems to be the one closer to the center-left of the image.\n\nStep 3: Confirming it's in the foreground:\n- The bear identified as second from the left appears to be in the foreground, as it is closer to the viewer than the others.\n\nStep 4: Providing the bounding box coordinates:\n- The bounding box coordinates will depend on the specific image resolution and how the image is cropped.
